# Trieste_Workshop

Welcome to this workshop! Hope you find it interesting 😁😁😁

It is recommended that you have an editor like VS Code or Pycharm installed in your computer.

1)	Download this Github Repository from: https://github.com/Computational-Modeling-Lab/Trieste_Workshop
2)	Extract the folder.
3)	Open your powershell and move in the folder Trieste_Workshop.
4)	Execute the command: pip install -r requirements.txt (This installs the required libraries).
5)	Run the command: python workshop.py --n [number_of_images_for_testing]

   number_of_images_for_testing=5 ->inference in 5 images
   
   number_of_images_for_testing=20 ->inference in 20 images
   
After that you can check the results in runs folder.
Moreover you can see the subset_test txt file the images that were used for inference and in subset_data xml file the location of subset_test txt file. This is a failsafe measure in order to ensure that the results that you see are correct. 

Thank you so much for your time!
